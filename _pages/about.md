I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) at the **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)**, where I am a member of the [StarAI Lab](https://starai.cs.ucla.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Guy Van den Broeck](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/).

My research lies at the intersection of **probabilistic machine learning** and **deep generative models**. I focus on the methodology, algorithms, and applications of **tractable probabilistic models**. My goal is to integrate these models with large foundation models (like LLMs) to enable **efficient and exact reasoning**. By improving their inference capabilities, I aim to make these powerful systems more **glass-box**, explainable, and reliable.
