My research aims to reimagine the current generative AI landscape by making foundation models more **glass-box**, **explainable**, and **efficient**.

My core approach is to fuse the complementary strengths of **deep generative models** (like LLMs and neural networks) with the formal guarantees of **tractable probabilistic graphical models**. While deep models are masters of learning from data, they often lack robust inference capabilities. Tractable models, conversely, provide a powerful framework for **efficient and exact reasoning**.

By integrating these paradigms, I develop new algorithms that augment large pre-trained systems with enhanced reasoning capacity. This enables complex probabilistic questions to be answered precisely, leading to more reliable control over model behavior and a clearer window into their decision-making processes.

### Key Research Focus

- **Methodology for Tractable Models:** Designing and applying tractable probabilistic graphical models to new challenges in AI.
- **Efficient and Exact Inference:** Developing scalable algorithms that bring formal reasoning to deep learning systems.
- **Integrating Generative & Probabilistic Models:** Building novel architectures where deep learning and tractable models work in concert.
- **Applications in AI Trustworthiness:** Focusing on explainability, controllability, and safety for foundation models.
